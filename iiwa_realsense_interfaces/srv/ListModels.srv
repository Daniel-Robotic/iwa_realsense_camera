# This service returns the list of available neural network models stored in the
# camera package directory. It allows runtime model discovery so users can switch
# models dynamically without hardcoding their names.
#
# Example use cases:
# - Displaying available models in a GUI or web dashboard
# - Validating requested model names before loading them
# - Automatically selecting models based on task or context

# ----------------------- Request -----------------------

# No request fields are needed â€” the service scans the model directory internally.

---

# ----------------------- Response -----------------------

bool success
# true  -> model directory was found and scanned successfully
# false -> model directory was missing or could not be accessed

string[] models
# List of available model files, given as relative paths from the model root.
# Examples:
# - "yolo8/pose/yolov8n-pose.pt"
# - "yolo8/segment/yolov8s-seg.engine"
# These can be passed directly to ChangeModel.srv

string message
# Diagnostic message describing the result.
# Examples:
# "OK"
# "models directory not found"
# "0 models found"
