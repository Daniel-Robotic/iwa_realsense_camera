# This service adjusts the cropping area and zoom level of the camera image stream.
# It is used to focus on a specific region of interest (ROI) within the captured image
# without changing the physical camera position or resolution.
#
# Example use cases:
# - Dynamically zoom in on a workspace or object being manipulated
# - Align the image view with a predefined area (e.g., calibration grid or assembly zone)
# - Reduce the image processing area for performance optimization

# ----------------------- Request -----------------------

float32 zoom_level
# Zoom factor to apply to the image.
# zoom_level > 1.0 -> zoom in (smaller cropped region scaled up)
# zoom_level = 1.0 -> no zoom (full image)
# Must be > 0.0

int32 crop_x_offset
# Horizontal offset (in pixels) for the top-left corner of the crop region.
# Must be ≥ 0 and such that the cropped region stays within image bounds.

int32 crop_y_offset
# Vertical offset (in pixels) for the top-left corner of the crop region.
# Must be ≥ 0 and such that the cropped region stays within image bounds.

# ----------------------- Response -----------------------

---
bool success
# true  -> crop parameters were accepted and applied
# false -> invalid parameters (e.g., zoom_level ≤ 0 or offsets out of bounds)

string message
# Descriptive result message.
# Examples:
# "Crop updated"
# "Invalid crop parameters"
