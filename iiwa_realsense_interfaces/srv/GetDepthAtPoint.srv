# This service returns the depth value (distance from camera) at a specified 2D pixel
# in the aligned depth image. It is useful when only the Z-coordinate is needed
# without full 3D deprojection.
#
# Example use cases:
# - Measuring how far an object is from the camera at a known image location
# - Verifying depth consistency for a detection
# - Triggering actions based on object proximity (e.g., stop if closer than threshold)

# ----------------------- Request -----------------------

uint16 x
# X-coordinate (column index) of the pixel in the depth image (0-based)

uint16 y
# Y-coordinate (row index) of the pixel in the depth image (0-based)

# ----------------------- Response -----------------------

---
float32 depth
# Depth value at the specified pixel, in millimeters or meters depending on camera setup.
# A value of 0.0 usually indicates invalid or missing depth data.

bool success
# true  -> depth value was read successfully
# false -> pixel was out of bounds or data was invalid

string message
# Informative result message.
# Examples:
# "Depth successfully obtained"
# "Coordinates out of bounds"
# "Depth data not available"
