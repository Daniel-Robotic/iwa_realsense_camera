# This service retrieves a 3D point in camera coordinate space corresponding to a given 2D pixel
# from the depth image. It performs deprojection using the camera intrinsics and depth data.
#
# Example use cases:
# - Picking up an object whose pixel location is known (e.g., from a detection)
# - Estimating the 3D pose of a point touched or clicked in the image
# - Tracking depth-based features in 3D space

# ----------------------- Request -----------------------

int32 x
# X-coordinate (column) of the pixel in the image (0-based index)

int32 y
# Y-coordinate (row) of the pixel in the image (0-based index)

# ----------------------- Response -----------------------

---
float32 x
# X-coordinate in 3D camera space (in meters), computed via deprojection

float32 y
# Y-coordinate in 3D camera space (in meters)

float32 z
# Z-coordinate (depth) in 3D camera space (in meters)

bool success
# true  -> deprojection succeeded
# false -> invalid pixel position or missing depth data

string message
# Human-readable message indicating result.
# Examples:
# "3D point obtained successfully"
# "Coordinates out of bounds"
