# This service is used to change the resolution and frame rate (FPS) of the RealSense camera
# during runtime. It allows the system to adapt to different vision tasks that require 
# higher speed (higher FPS) or better image quality (higher resolution).
#
# Example use cases:
# - Increase resolution to detect small objects more accurately
# - Decrease resolution and FPS to reduce CPU load when high speed is not required
# - Adjust camera profile dynamically depending on robot state or task

# ----------------------- Request -----------------------
